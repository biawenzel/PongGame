# PongGame
This is a a copy of the classic Pong Game, where 2 players battle for points (very much alike with a tennis game).
This project was made during the Programming Logic course, from Alura platform.

### How to play?
#### Use W/S to move the left racket, and UP/DOWN arrows to move the right one. Enjoy, it! :)
